## Deployed Web App

We used **Streamlit Cloud** to host and deploy our application:  
üîó **[Best Friends Furever App](https://bestfriendsfurever.streamlit.app/)**

---

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a **comprehensive pet adoption website** that streamlines the adoption process through:  

- A **user-friendly interface** to browse available pets, add new pets for adoption, and manage data.  
- Normalizing raw CSV pet adoption data into a **structured SQLite database**.  
- **LangChain integration** for natural language queries, allowing users to search the pet catalog intuitively.  

This project demonstrates **practical skills** in database management, web development, and applied AI.

## Tools & Technologies

1. **Database**: SQLite ‚Äì lightweight, simple, and Python-friendly.  
2. **Password Hashing**: SHA256 for secure password storage.  
3. **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python) for building interactive web interfaces quickly.  
4. **Natural Language Querying**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 via **LangChain** to query the SQLite database using everyday language.  
5. **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud for direct GitHub integration and hosting.

## Data

**Source**: Downloaded from Kaggle *(link placeholder)*  

**Tables**:  
- **intake** ‚Äì Intake types (Owner Surrender, Stray, Foster, etc.)  
- **adoption_status** ‚Äì Boolean flag for adoption status.  
- **pet_size** ‚Äì Pet size categories (Small, Medium, Large).  
- **sex_type** ‚Äì Sex types (Male, Female, Unidentified, Neutral, Spayed).  
- **animal** ‚Äì Main pet details (type, name, breed, intake date, age, color, size, sex, URL, notes).

**Key Database Details**:  
- Preloaded data for `pet_size`, `intake_type`, and `sex_type`.  
- Adoption status defaults to **0** (not adopted).  
- CSV data is processed and inserted into `animal`.  
- Foreign keys ensure referential integrity.  
- Primary key: `animal_id`.

### 5. Pet Catalog
- **3xN card grid** of pets showing:
  - Picture, Name, Age, Breed, Sex.  
- **"View Details"** button for more info.  
- LangChain-powered natural language queries.  
  Example queries:
  - `Show me foster pets`  
  - `Blue or Yellow pets`  
  - `Black dogs`  
  - `Show me female birds that are blue`  

### 6. Pet Details
- Full pet information display.  
- Adoption button updates status to ‚Äú**ALREADY ADOPTED**‚Äù.

### 7. Submit New Pet

- Intake date set to submission date.  
- Image stored as BLOB in SQLite.

##  Issues & Challenges

1. Limited CSS & UI customization options in Streamlit.  
2. Difficulty with pixel-based component positioning.  
3. Button click events overwriting each other in Streamlit.  
4. Complex prompt engineering for **natural language ‚Üí SQL** mapping.  
5. Data type casting for fields like AGE to improve AI query accuracy.
